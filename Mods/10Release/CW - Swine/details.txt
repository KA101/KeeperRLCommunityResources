"Shadowing"
"Rise of Swine

My first attempts at summoning were crude and the results, disappointing. 
I soon found however, that the type and condition of the host's meat was a critical factor. 
The best results came from pigs, whose flesh is most like that of man.
	
Faction with minimal economy based on darkest dungeon swine.
