P("Materials of the Mod of Bonus") 
P("--------------------------------")
P("Keepers coming to the realms of BonusMod frequently find themselves confused by the additional materials they encounter.  This humble guidebook shall attempt to give visitors the native's understanding of the resources available, both those found solely in Bonus as well as familiar from Vanilla, using the idea of 'Tiers' to help organize materials.")
P("")
P("Tier 0: Leather & Lumber")
P("While most Keepers scoff at leather and wooden gear, both as something fit for commoners and all-too-familiar from Vanilla, it can nevertheless be useful to groups just making their way in the realm.  In particular, your craftspeople are adept at securing skins for leather and needn't expend resources (which you may, temporarily, not have) in order to improve your survivability.  While you might look at leather gear and think 'ugh, I wouldn't be seen dead in that', the protection leather offers will reduce your chances of being seen dead...as compared to cotton or silk robes and footwraps.")
P("")
P("Tier 1: Iron")
P("Access to metal arms and (in particular) armor can be the defining factor that separates 'respectable Keeper' from 'bandit chief holed up in a hole'.  Iron equpment will significantly boost your creatures' survivability and damage output in melee.  Though some Keepers believe that it is more efficient to forgo Iron equipment in favor of developing a Steel manufacturing facility and directly fitting their troops with the high-status Steel...these Keepers never seem to be very old.")
P("")
P("There have been rumors that Iron somehow opposes magic.  As yet, the primary basis for these rumors is the lack of mage staves and armor made from iron...")
P("")
P("Tier 1.5: Steel")
P("Every crafter worthy of the title in BonusMod has heard of Steel.  It's Iron with all the junk pounded out of it over very, very high heat, and anyone who can be trusted to work Iron can be trusted to pound it into Steel.  Once so refined, Steel weapons and armor perform much better than Iron, and can also serve mages as a solid alternative to Archwood. Unfortunately, the heat required needs a LOT of lumber, enough that the Dryads and Tree Spirits have forcibly closed down attempts by enterprising Dukes to manufacture Steel.  It's simply not worth the effort, and more importantly the casualties, to marshal thousands of units of Wood to heat the forge for a few hundred units of Steel. Thus, Steel gear is primarily seen either from the Dwarves, presumably derived from deep coal seams or some other underground heat source, or held by troops with wealthy noble backers, who can afford to purchase Dwarven steel.  That said, Keepers who manage to manufacture Steel equipment in quantity could overcome larger and longer-established groups...which is why younger, less-experienced Keepers lust for Steel, forgoing Iron, and frequently do not live to tell others of their mistake.")
P("")
P("Certain disreputable factions whisper about 'dark steel' and 'hellsteel'.  While, in theory, sufficently powerful magic could replace the 'junk' pounded out of Iron to make Steel with more powerful substances, any such infusion would represent, at best, significant and exploitable moral corruption.  Factions doing so would, one way or another, soon learn the error of their ways...")
P("")
P("Tier 2: Adamantine, Venorack, and Caelidite")
P("Most Keepers arriving in the realms are familiar with Adamantine.  It's more common here than it is in the vales of Vanilla, but still requires skilled crafters to handle.  One thing that such Keepers might not understand is that BonusMod Keepers commonly set aside 20 or 40 adamantine to upgrade their forges: Adamantine metalworking tools are lighter, stronger, and all-around more effective, letting crafters accomplish more work with less effort and helping reduce some of the skill requirements.  An Adamantine Forge is the mark of a leader who takes metalwork seriously.")
P("")
P("Crafters who can handle Adamantine can, with a little additional research, also handle Venorack and Caelidite.  These magical metals are roughly as protective (or punishing) as Adamantine equipment, but with the proper technological know-how, can be forged into Venorack gear that is innately Poison-elemental (inflicting or protecting against Poison, without need for glyphs or other expensive enchantment) or Caelidite gear, similarly Acid-elemental.  Most faction leaders will invest in a Venorack helmet, sheld, or gauntlets *just in case* they fight someone using poison.")
P("")
P("Tier 3: Adoxium, Infernite, and Jothnite")
P("Again, most Villains from Vanilla (if the reader will pardon the pun) are familiar wth Adoxium and Infernite.  And again, those are more common here, in particular appearing significicantly shallower than they appear in Vanilla, and sometimes factions will hold supplies of these (or other) ores as valuables.  Further, some enterprising metalworkers have, if the rumor is to be believed, developed Infernite and Adoxium forges.")
P("")
P("Infernite forges are said to operate at high heat, allowing crafters to work the metal for long periods without reheating it (and providing enough light to work by).  Such a forge would be the perfect place to refine Steel in quantity.  Adoxium forges allegedly channel magical energy into their products, resulting in weapons and armor beyond the ken of mere mortals, but properly handling such energies in addition to physically shaping the metal would require craftsfolk of the highest skill.  Unlike adamantine forges, however, these are more the realm of speculation and rumor, rather than the aspiration seen with Adamantine.")
P("")
P("Further, access to greater quantities of Infernite has led to armorers developing Infernite past its more common use as 'fire weapon' into a full line of armor as well as weaponry.  While some Keepers dispute the worth of armor that gives off light, it provides very solid protection (more than Adamantine), innately resists fire, and can give off shockwaves or, more commonly seen with weapons, be harnessed to throw a fireball.")
P("")
P("Jothnite is, essentially, an ice version of Infernite.  It's as difficult to work, and as effective at its task.  Though it is not quite as amenable to magical projection, it also does not glow and thereby give away the positions of troops at night.  Jothnite gauntlets have proven popular with soldiers who appreciate their ability to freeze fleeing felons from afar.")
