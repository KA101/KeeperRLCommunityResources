P("___________________________________________________________")
P("")
P("Keepers coming to the realms of BonusMod frequently find themselves confused by the multitude of different factions.  This humble guidebook shall attempt to give visitors the native's understanding of their neighbors, both those inclined to Law and the more Evil groups of the realms.")
P("")
P("Major Villains")
P("")
P("While several of these are upstanding creatures who have brought Lawful peace and prosperity to the realm, others consider them Villains precisely for that reason.  Others' Evil is legend, spoken in hushed tones and only written here because the author remains nameless...")
P("")
P("The KING")
P("His Majesty the King is the unquestioned sovereign of the realm.  While he has aged and no longer leads from the front, leaving that duty to his Dukes, he retains enough combat skill to put the best weapon and armor available to good use should one cross him.")
P("The King rules from a substantial castle, with smaller settlements around it, all well-defended by his knights.  The castle itself accommodates knights, archers, and priests of superior skill to those encountered in the service of lesser rulers, along with doughty Adventurers such as Mages, Warriors, and Rangers. While the King's troops from time to time take losses, the prestige of serving the Sovereign ensures that the King can routinely recruit the best soldiers to replace his fallen heroes.")
P("Being the overall ruler of the realm, the King generally does not send his troops against minor threats, again preferring to allow his subordinates to deal with the problem unless they aggress against his people personally or have grown unmanageable by anything less.  Conversely, he does not suffer thieves or challengers to his rule. Less-reputable types insist that they saw the King personally break the thrones of several goblin realms as a warning to those who would test him.")
P("")
P("The Shadow King")
P("The shadowy realms of the dead routinely attempt to mock the customs of the living, and their Shadow King lives up to type.  While his palace is fit only to hold undead troops and the most depraved of Assassins, he is an Evil analogue to the Lawful sovereign in all other matters.")
P("")
P("Greater Dragon Nests")
P("Most dragons prefer to live alone and claim substantial territory.  On occasion, however, dragons who live to substantial age establish control over similarly ancient forts of volcanic rock.  Rather than fight over the warm and spacious lair, they adopt other dragons and form something of a family group; whle Red dragons lead the nest, Green and the otherwise-rare Yellow dragons are common, as are younger dragons.  (White dragons understandably prefer other biomes, and Black dragons thrive deep underground.) Smaller winged creatures akin to kobolds, 'dragonewts', commonly attend these nests but do not seem to be a stage in the draconic lifecycle.")
P("Unfortunately, such dragon families are ever-attentive to outside threats, and settlements that have defeated more than one outside threat may well find themselves the nest's target.  While the prospect of several dragons coooperatively descending upon one's settlement may quite rightly be terrifying, the draconic lifecycle is such that they will not reproduce within a human lifetime: any dragon felled by your archers will stay dead.  At worst, the nest may take on another dragonewt.")
P("")
P("Amazons")
P("First documented by the remarkable Lord Tillion, these fierce warrior tribes regard all as hostile, but loathe the undead in particular.  Every Amazon is allegedly sworn to slay the undead or herself be killed in the fight.  Their Queen's beauty exceeds that of mortal women--Lord Tillion reported an inability to think of any hostile action in her presence--but is matched by her martial prowess. Her council of Elders are competent casters and spiritualists, with their spirit attendants well capable of seeing off challengers. 'Lesser' Amazons are nevertheless competent melee warriors, and there have been rumors of archers more predator than person, recently derived as a means to hunt the undead when the sun is not available.")
P("The Queen does not approve of large settlements nearby and is prone to send attacks if so many as 15 combat-capable foes congregate...since practical-minded Keepers aware of Amazonian martial traditions and willing to disassociate from the undead have been known to recruit Amazons by whatever means available, the Queen's concern is unfortunately warranted.")
P("")
P("Centaurs")
P("The horse-people have an abiding distaste for 'greenskins' such as goblins, orcs, and harpies, resulting in their being more or less eternal friends of Lawful Keepers and foes of Evil Keepers.  While the reasons for their distaste are unclear, the risk they pose is not: they're very fast and mostly archers, so can be a serious threat to anyone caught in the open. Further, their royal maintains a solid force of well-trained archers, knights, and priestesses, in a palace commparable to that of His Majesty the King.")
P("Fortunately, the centaur royal is confident in his troops' abilities, and requires provocation slightly lesser than that of the King himself in order to dispatch his troops on the attack.  Those incurring such wrath, though, would be well-advised to channel attacks through the terrain and take full advantage of chokepoints and blind corners.")
P("")
P("Cow Demons")
P("It's unclear whether the Cow Demons were an earlier attempt to ccreate Minotaurs or the result of diabolic breeding experiments.  In any evvent, while they are indeed dangerous, their danger is lies more in mass numbers opposing attackers orced to descend into their lair: the true Minotaurs sometimes found therein are pound-for-pound fiercer fighters with the strength and canniness to bear another fighter on their back.")
P("While the Cow Demon Lord has been known to bear a uniquely feared weapon, and to send attacks against settlements that have started pacifying their surroundings, on the whole his troops are not so feared as others may be.")
P("")
P("Hell Portals")
P("On occasion infernal lords manage to break through into the mortal realm.  Typically, such breakthroughs happen deep underground where they're effectively entombed and of no concern to surface-dwellers.  However, where the underground breaks through to the surface, a hell portal can allow an infernal invasion force to ravage the vicinity.  They are generally well-armed and trained, their infernal armor provides good protection against arrows and spells, and their hatred of humans knows no bounds.")
P("Hell's troops take note of settlements which have made efforts to pacify the surrounding area; conversely, they are dependent on their portal for reinforcements, and while the portal is strongly built, resistant to magical energies, and can release magical energies to defend itself...ultimately it is an immobile metal construct. Destroying the portal will not send its troops kicking & screaming back to Hell, but will prevent them from repopulating.")
P("")
P("Illusia the Fairy Goddess")
P("Of all the forces in the realms, this is the one your author would consider most dangerous.  Most surface-dwellers can go their whole lives without encountering the fae.  Miners encountering ore deposits where fae have made their home don't always manage to make note of the fact before being killed.  The bad part, you see, is that such deaths are from two or three of the Fae Queen's subjects.")
P("Goddess Illusia resides in a tower, which is presumably full of such subjects. While the fae are loath to provide their actual names, she is known as 'Illusia' due to her ability to quickly and effectively create a great many, all very effective, illusions of herself.  Unlike common illusions which look real enough but can neither attack or withstand an attack, Illusia's illusions are pefectly capable of both absorbing damage and (more importantly) dealing damage.  One particularly brave--but luckless--fool told Illusia that she was not a goddess. When his journal was later recovered, Illusia's subjects had gone to some trouble to describe his fate, though they then commented that clearly someone so daft could not exist, indicating that the whole thing was clearly a 'mortal tale' told to amusingly educate others.")
P("With that in mind, the best course is clearly not to antagonize Illusia at all. This isn't that difficult a task, since (as a Goddess) she takes fairly little notice of factions not actively antagonizing her; settlements must be fairly large or dominating the realm before she will send her beloved subjects to lay siege.  Conversely, the defenders who escaped her wrath upon Ironharbour reported about 15 fairies...who each summoned three or four more.  Each of whom could then call upon elementals, golems, or both.")
P("")
P("Necromancers")
P("On occasion a Necromancer moves in on a graveyard and installs themself underground.  Unlike the more commonplace and minor Zombie infestations, Necromancers install totems which constantly raise more dead and carve out rooms, in similar fashion to Evil Keepers. Further, they typically have stronger help, with mummies and skeletal mages being commonplace.")
P("However, these Necromancers have sunk much of their power into their totems, and pointedly lack the ability to assemble and animate vampires, let alone freakish undead abominations. The inability to replace their more advanced minions is one vulnerability, but ultimately a force of strong melee troops is generally required to cut through the tides of undead flesh and destroy the totems.")
P("")
P("Goblin King")
P("Though not to His Majesty's standard, a goblin who has managed to retain goblins recognizing him as a royal is a remarkably dangerous adversary, one very easy to underestimate.  In particular, goblins with this level of organization regularly have arcane research programs, giving rise to goblin wizards capable of freezing strong champions while the goblins chip them to pieces.  Worse are the fabled goblin kaboomers.  No matter how well-armed and armored the stalwart opposition, one kaboomer closes to melee range and it's all over.")
P("Despite these challenges, an organized force with a solid melee screen and plenty of ranged support stands a good chance of clearing out the Green King's overground defenses.  It's been done before.  Any Duke could conquer the fort in a single day's punitive raid.  Rooting their infestation out of their chambers below is another matter entirely.  They routinely dwell in large underground chambers, with no regard for privacy until reaching the Green King himself.  Attackers coming in the middle of the night, with the defenders sleeping, are still forced through a single-stairway chokepoint.  It's quite common for one defender be awake to see and sound the alarm, summoning additional goblins to the fight, well before the invasion force can establish itself on the new floor.  To the degree that one's troops can either enter and fight invisibly, or summon disposable elementals or golems to help secure the landing, those are the best ways to invade the depths.")
P("")
P("Grimtooth's Lair")
P("From time to time the legndary trapmaker troll Grimtooth mines out a cavern system and installs a mess of traps within. The traps are as hazardous to the cavern's inhabitants as they are to intruders, but nevertheless do a fine job of protecting the lair.  To this day, no adventurer has managed to both reach Grimtooth's living quarters *and return* with the troll, alive or dead...")
P("Explorers with greater discretion than valor have reported that the traps are constantly active: being able to spot them helps, but they had no luck disarming them.  It might be better to be fast or have the ability to teleport, rather than planning to undo Grimtooth's work.")
P("")
P("The Dwarf Queen")
P("Her Dwarven Majesty maintains a citadel in a hollowed-out volcano, with shops and mines below.  While she is personally well-equipped, the adventurers present in her court and her Barons are equal to many challengers. Further, the Dwarves can and do produce adamantine gear in quantities suitable to equip their royal's rank and file.")
P("Conversely, some Keepers with more morbid tendencies have been known to deliberately provoke her assaults, as it is difficult to have too much adamantine.  Necromancers in particular would generally prefer to remain in the Dwarf Queen's aggressions for a long time, especially given the rumors that the citadel, despite being inside the volcano, nevertheless permits sufficient sunlight to enter that the entire fastness is considered 'outside'.")
P("However, more Lawful keepers will find no greater ally than the Dwarves.  In particular, the Queen's own smiths and miners, while not cheap to hire, can prove well-worth their commission.")
P("")
P("The Elf King")
P("Elf lords frequently live with other elves around and the Elf King is no exception.  Unlike the lords found in more vanilla realms, though the Elf King's personal desmene contains several lords and plenty of archers, with lesser but archer-staffed settlements nearby. Human rangers routinely avail themselves of the Elf King's hospitality and will gladly aid in his defense.  All in all, the King of the Elves can mount a determined guerilla defense against invading forces, with flight or elf-vision being mandatory to have any idea what's going on.")
P("With the Elf King's focus on playing to his people's strengths, Keepers opposing them might do well to lure the Elves in for an attack.  This is not trivial, as the Elf King takes the typical royal outlook and will ignore lesser threats, but luring out irreplaceable elf lords may make the final assault less dangerous.")
P("")
P("The Castle Witch")
P("While most witches tend to set up operations in the swamps, every so often one recruits a staff of avian simians and sets themselves up in a castle.")
P("Aside from this staff, such witches are not that much more dangerous or special than their sisters.  A force geared to sort out the swamps should have no trouble dealing with a Castle Cornelia.")
P("")
P("The Noble Wizard")
P("On occasion a Wizard serves His Majesty the King in similar fashion to one of the Dukes. Though they are not generally granted the title, such 'noble wizards' are essentially similar to a Duke in most regards; they are less likely to challenge one to a duel, for better or worse, and hae arcanists and footmen rather than the Duke's knights, but given their supply of Steeds, they shoud not be taken lightly.")
P("Aside from more magic-missiles being mixed in with the archers, the Noble Wizard is fundamentally comparable to the Duke, and should be dealt with in similar fashion.  Avoid being caught in large open spaces, focus fire, breach the gate en masse, etc.")
P("")
P("Snow Raiders")
P("Bandits adapted for living in the frozen wastes of BonusMod, these Raiders take in young troops who learn as they go.  Successful such raiders develop their skills and ultimately specialize; in particular, some focus on training and raising dogs, sometimes looking rather canid themselves in the bargain, whereas others channel legendary cannibal spirits and fight very much like werewolves.")
P("Such raiders will also develop themselves in a Keeper's service.  As such, forward-thinking Keepers have been known to take as many alive as possible, in hopes of obtaining troops with valuable skills. As a fighting force, though, the Snow Raiders are no more dangerous than the typical organized bandit groups.")
P("")
P("Abbeys")
P("The realms of BonusMod have seen rather a lot of armed conflict through the ages, and it is understandable that some would prefer to cloister themselves into a life of religious contemplation.  It is also understandable that they might be called upon to contain particularly dangerous demons.  And human fraility being what it is...it might also be, sadly, understandable that some abbeys have instead fallen to temptation and now consort with the demons they were supposed to oppose and confine.")
P("Keepers will find that abbeys matching their alignment are generally supportive, though perhaps attentive more to their property than to charity, while opposing abbeys are understandably hostile. Monks and their spiritual advisors are generally not that suited to pitched battle, though. In the case of a coaligned abbey, Keepers would be well advised to commune with the abbey's patron at its shrine.  The patron may be *quite* generous to those who serve it.")
P("")
P("Desert Thieves")
P("Extreme biomes of themselves do not force folks to specialize, but the thieves agree with the Raiders that it is best to start young.  Mainline Thieves develop competency with traps, the Slicers are fearsome warriors akin to the Knight Keepers themselves, and Sorcerers are famous for their flight and tricks with discarded gear, along with getting the defensve totem set up. Those able, typically ride into battle on camelback.")
P("While it remains useful to capture the young thieves and train them, the addition of camelry makes the Desert Thieves a greater threat, somewhat along the lines of the Duke. Ranged support and confined spaces will, as usual, be a great help.")
P("")
P("Pyramid")
P("Desert factions of long ago built these substantial stone structures. The residents work well together, with each floor functioning as a separate subfaction yet cooperating in attacks on interloping Keepers.")
P("Mummies are well-trained and reasonably-equipped warriors and priests, yet retain the basic difficulties of mummies: they're slow and subject to dismemberment. Fast and competent troops can easily see them off.")
P("")
P("Wolf Warriors")
P("These fell fellows mix the shamanism and the warrior traditions of more vanilla warrior clans.  In addition to shamans and bear-morphing warriors, the actual wolf warriors can call wolves to harass hostiles, and go invisible themselves to flank their prey.")
P("However, summoned wolves are summons and will disperse if their Warrior is slain.  Attention to details, as well as telepathy, will go a long way toward minimizing the Wolf Warrior threat.")
