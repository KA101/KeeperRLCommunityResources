P("___________________________________________________________")
P("")
P("Keepers coming to the realms of BonusMod frequently find themselves confused by the multitude of different factions.  This humble guidebook shall attempt to give visitors the native's understanding of their neighbors, both those inclined to Law and the more Evil groups of the realms.")
P("")
P("Major Villains")
P("")
P("While several of these are upstanding creatures who have brought Lawful peace and prosperity to the realm, others consider them Villains precisely for that reason.  Others' Evil is legend, spoken in hushed tones and only written here because the author remains nameless...")
P("")
P("The KING")
P("His Majesty the King is the unquestioned sovereign of the realm.  While he has aged and no longer leads from the front, leaving that duty to his Dukes, he retains enough combat skill to put the best weapon and armor available to good use should one cross him.")
P("The King rules from a substantial castle, with smaller settlements around it, all well-defended by his knights.  The castle itself accommodates knights, archers, and priests of superior skill to those encountered in the service of lesser rulers, along with doughty Adventurers sugh as Mages, Warriors, and Rangers. While the King's troops from time to time take losses, the prestige of serving the Sovereign ensures that the King can routinely recruit the best soldiers to replace his fallen heroes.")
P("Being the overall ruler of the realm, the King generally does not send his troops against minor threats, again preferring to allow his subordinates to deal with the problem unless they aggress against his people personally or have grown unmanageable by anything less.  Conversely, he does not suffer thieves or challengers to his rule. Less-reputable types insist that they saw the King personally break the thrones of several goblin realms as a warning to those who would test him.")
P("")
P("The Shadow King")
P("The shadowy realms of the dead routinely attempt to mock the customs of the living, and their Shadow King lives up to type.  While his palace is fit only to hold undead troops and the most depraved of Assassins, he is an Evil analogue to the Lawful sovereign in all other matters.")
P("")
P("Greater Dragon Nests")
P("Most dragons prefer to live alone and claim substantial territory.  On occasion, however, dragons who live to substantial age establish control over similarly ancient forts of volcanic rock.  Rather than fight over the warm and spacious lair, they adopt other dragons and form something of a family group; whle Red dragons lead the nest, Green and the otherwise-rare Yellow dragons are common, as are younger dragons.  (White dragons understandably prefer other biomes, and Black dragons thrive deep underground.) Smaller winged creatures akin to kobolds, 'dragonewts', commonly attend these nests but do not seem to be a stage in the draconic lifecycle.")
P("Unfortunately, such dragon families are ever-attentive to outside threats, and settlements that have defeated more than one outside threat may well find themselves the nest's target.  While the prospect of several dragons coooperatively descending upon one's settlement may quite rightly be terrifying, the draconic lifecycle is such that they will not reproduce within a human lifetime: any dragon felled by your archers will stay dead.  At worst, the nest may take on another dragonewt.")
P("")
P("Amazons")
P("First documented by the remarkable Lord Tillion, these fierce warrior tribes regard all as hostile, but loathe the undead in particular.  Every Amazon is allegedly sworn to slay the undead or herself be killed in the fight.  Their Queen's beauty exceeds that of mortal women--Lord Tillion reported an inability to think of any hostile action in her presence--but is matched by her martial prowess. Her council of Elders are competent casters and spiritualists, with their spirit attendants well capable of seeing off challengers. 'Lesser' Amazons are nevertheless competent melee warriors, and there have been rumors of archers more predator than person, recently derived as a means to hunt the undead when the sun is not available.")
P("The Queen does not approve of large settlements nearby and is prone to send attacks if so many as 15 combat-capable foes congregate...since practical-minded Keepers aware of Amazonian martial traditions and willing to disassociate from the undead have been known to recruit Amazons by whatever means available, the Queen's concern is unfortunately warranted.")
P("")
P("Centaurs")
P("The horse-people have an abiding distaste for 'greenskins' such as goblins, orcs, and harpies, resulting in their being more or less eternal friends of Lawful Keepers and foes of Evil Keepers.  While the reasons for their distaste are unclear, the risk they pose is not: they're very fast and mostly archers, so can be a serious threat to anyone caught in the open. Further, their royal maintains a solid force of well-trained archers, knights, and priestesses, in a palace commparable to that of His Majesty the King.")
P("Fortunately, the centaur royal is confident in his troops' abilities, and requires provocation slightly lesser than that of the King himself in order to dispatch his troops on the attack.  Those incurring such wrath, though, would be well-advised to channel attacks through the terrain and take full advantage of chokepoints and blind corners.")
P("")
P("Cow Demons")
P("It's unclear whether the Cow Demons were an earlier attempt to ccreate Minotaurs or the result of diabolic breeding experiments.  In any evvent, while they are indeed dangerous, their danger is lies more in mass numbers opposing attackers orced to descend into their lair: the true Minotaurs sometimes found therein are pound-for-pound fiercer fighters with the strength and canniness to bear another fighter on their back.")
P("While the Cow Demon Lord has been known to bear a uniquely feared weapon, and to send attacks against settlements that have started pacifying their surroundings, on the whole his troops are not so feared as others may be.")
P("")
P("Hell Portals")
P("On occasion infernal lords manage to break through into the mortal realm.  Typically, such breakthroughs happen deep underground where they're effectively entombed and of no concern to surface-dwellers.  However, where the underground breaks through to the surface, a hell portal can allow an infernal invasion force to ravage the vicinity.  They are generally well-armed and trained, their infernal armor provides good protection against arrows and spells, and their hatred of humans knows no bounds.")
P("Hell's troops take note of settlements which have made efforts to pacify the surrounding area; conversely, they are dependent on their portal for reinforcements, and while the portal is strongly built, resistant to magical energies, and can release magical energies to defend itself...ultimately it is an immobile metal construct. Destroying the portal will not send its troops kicking & screaming back to Hell, but will prevent them from repopulating.")
P("")
P("Illusia the Fairy Goddess")
P("Of all the forces in the realms, this is the one your author would consider most dangerous.  Most surface-dwellers can go their whole lives without encountering the fae.  Miners encountering ore deposits where fae have made their home don't always manage to make note of the fact before being killed.  The bad part, you see, is that such deaths are from two or three of Illusia's subjects.")
P("The Queen resides in a tower, which is presumably full of such subjects. While the fae are loath to provide their actual names, she is known as 'Illusia' due to her ability to quickly and effectively create a great many, all very effective, illusions of herself.  Unlike common illusions which look real enough but cannot attack or withstand an attack, Illusia's illusions are pefectly capable of both absorbing damage and (more importantly) dealing damage.  One particularly brave--but luckless--fool told Illusia that she was not a goddess. When his journal was later recovered, Illusia's subjects had gone to some trouble to describe his fate, though they then commented that clearly someone so daft could not exist.")
P("With that in mind, the best course is clearly not to antagonize Illusia at all. This isn't that difficult a task, since (as a Goddess) she takes fairly little notice of factions not actively antagonizing her; settlements must be fairly large or dominating the realm before she will send her beloved subjects to lay siege.  Conversely, the defenders who escaped her wrath upon Ironharbour reported about 15 fairies...who each summoned three or four more.  Each of whom could then call upon elementals, golems, or both.")
