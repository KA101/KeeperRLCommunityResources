# Learning how to make random layouts #

#Each random map has a name eg. "simple_cave"
#Each random map is enclosed in { }
#Each independent instruction is called a "generator".
#Each random map contains an independent instruction (generator) to draw itself inside the { }

#Generators build maps by enclosing other generators.
#Generators can be nested as deep as you like.

#Double click this link and paste in generators inside the { } to test them:
# https://keeperrl.com/~michal/umg/

#Example random map:


#The outer part enclosed below in { } is a special unnested generator that contains a chain of generators
#The chain of generators specifies how to fill a rectangular map space of unspecified dimensions.


"simple_cave" #Layout name.

#Paste everything below here into the URL to test it
{

  #This line is a nested generator at depth 1 (first in chain)
  Set("rock") 
  
  #This block is a nested generator at depth 1  (second in chain)
  Inside(1, {
  
	#This block is a #nested generator at depth 1
    Place({3 3},
      Reset("floor", "room_floor"), #Without the comma, this block is a nested generator at depth 2
      6
    )
	
	#This block is a #nested generator at depth 1
    Connect(On("floor"),
      5, On("rock"), Reset("floor")
    )
  })
  
  #nested generator at depth 1 (3rd in chain)
  Place(
    {1 1},
    Set("monster"), #Without the comma, this block is a nested generator at depth 2
    4,
    On("room_floor") #This line is a nested generator at depth 2
  )
}
