"Swishos/Shadowing"
"Welcome to the Purelands! The main aim for this mod is to make the overworld more interesting to explore, this has been done with new enemies, resources, biomes and items.



The Mod also retextures a huge portion of the game with my eventual goal to retexture the entire game ^^ (currently 488 custom made textures and still counting)
